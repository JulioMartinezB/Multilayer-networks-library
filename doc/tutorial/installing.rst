Downloading and installing
==========================

The easiest way to install pymnet is via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pymnet

We recommend installing into a virtual environment (managed, e.g., with virtualenv, conda, mamba, or poetry).
Afterwards, the installation should work out-of-the-box.

Alternatively, you can download the latest source files directly from our `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/mnets/pymnet>`_ as a zip file,
or you can use git to clone the repository, for example, via HTTPS:

.. code-block:: none

   $ git clone https://github.com/mnets/pymnet.git
