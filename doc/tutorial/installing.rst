Downloading and installing
==========================

The easiest way to install pymnet is via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pymnet

We recommend installing into a virtual environment (e.g., managed with virtualenv, conda, or poetry).
Afterwards, the installation should work out-of-the-box.

Alternatively, you can download the latest source files directly from the repository https://github.com/bolozna/Multilayer-networks-library as a zip file,
or you can use Git to clone the repository:

.. code-block:: none

   $ git clone git@github.com:bolozna/Multilayer-networks-library.git

The current version of the library is written purely in Python, and simply adding the library directory to your Python path is enough to start using it.
